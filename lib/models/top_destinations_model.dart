          'Pasumpahan Island is in the waters of Bungus Teluk Kabung District, Padang City, West Sumatra. The beauty of the sea makes this island look beautiful. That’s why many local and foreign tourists—especially snorkelling lovers—visit this island. On the north side of the island, a 100-meter hill can be the best spot to view the island and the vast ocean. With five-hectare areas, the island offers clear water and three-coloured gradations: limpid on the beach, slightly greenish to the middle of the beach, and bluish in the middle of the sea. The island has complete tourist facilities, such as places to relax, bathrooms, water sports rides, a camping ground, volleyball courts, and a mosque. Undoubtedly, your vacation on this tiny island with blue shades will be exciting.'),
